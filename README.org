This repository contains my Emacs configuration which is built using [[https://github.com/akirak/emacs-twist][emacs-twist]].
I use home-manager to install the configuration.

It is an org-babel configuration defined within [[file:emacs/emacs-config.org][a single file]].

If you are have Nix 2.9+ installed, you can try out the Emacs configuration without installation.

There are two variants of the configuration.
One is pgtk one, which works on Wayland:

#+begin_src bash
   nix run github:akirak/emacs-config#default-pgtk.wrappers.tmpdir
#+end_src

Another is non-pgtk one:

#+begin_src bash
   nix run github:akirak/emacs-config#default-x11.wrappers.tmpdir
#+end_src

Both commands creates a temporary directory which will be used as ~user-emacs-directory~ containing an init file.
The temporary directory will be cleaned up when Emacs exits.
