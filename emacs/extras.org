* Extra Configurations for Specific Tasks
Emacs is a framework for building frontend applications, and it is possible to create a /specialized configuration/ for a specific set of tasks.

This file is a collection of configurations that should be built and installed only on relevant machines.
They serve as extensions to [[file:emacs-config.org][the basic configuration]]. [[file:overlay.nix][overlay.nix]] defines profiles using these extra configurations.
** beancount
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setup (:package beancount)
    (:nixpkgs "beancount" "fava")
  
    ;; I don't like the default keybindings on C-c, so change the prefix.
    (:option beancount-mode-map-prefix (kbd akirak/mode-prefix-key))
  
    (:with-mode beancount-mode
      (:file-match "\\.beancount\\'" "\\.bean\\'")

        (:hook
         (defun akirak/beancount-turn-on-outline-mode ()
           (outline-minor-mode t)))
