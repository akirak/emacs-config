* Emacs Configuration
This is an Emacs configuration that uses [[https://github.com/akirak/emacs-twist][emacs-twist]] to manage package version.
It is currently work in progress.

I am still using my previous configuration.
I am gradually switching to this configuration for simple tasks, but I have not finished the migration yet.
** Structure
[[file:emacs-config.org][emacs-config.org]] contains the configuration.

The following files and directories are needed for building the configuration using Twist:

- [[file:lock/][lock/]]: A directory for lock files.
- [[file:recipes/][recipes/]]: Custom recipes for packages that are not available on any package registry.

[[file:.org-config.el][.org-config.el]] contains my Org configuration for maintaining the configuration. See [[file:emacs-config.org::#develop-org-configuration][a note]]
for details.
Once I finish migration to this Emacs configuration, I will probably deprecate this Org configuration file.
