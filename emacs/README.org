* Emacs Configuration
This is an Emacs configuration that uses [[https://github.com/akirak/emacs-twist][emacs-twist]] to manage package version.

** Structure
The following files configure Emacs Lisp packages:

- [[file:emacs-config.org][emacs-config.org]]: The main configuration file.
- [[file:compat.el][compat.el]]: A compatibility layer for myself. Its content is mostly keybindings I grew in [[https://github.com/akirak/emacs.d/][my previous config]].
- [[file:extras.org][extras.org]]: A collection of extra configurations for specific contexts.

The following files should be the contents of =user-emacs-directory=:

- [[file:early-init.el][early-init.el]]
- [[file:init.el][init.el]]

The following files and directories are needed for building the configuration using Twist:

- [[file:sources/][sources/]]: A directory for lock files.
- [[file:recipes/][recipes/]]: Custom recipes for packages that are not available on any package registry.
- [[file:inventories/flake.nix][inventories/flake.nix]]: Track registries of Emacs Lisp packages.

[[file:.org-config.el][.org-config.el]] contains my Org configuration for maintaining the configuration. See [[file:emacs-config.org::#develop-org-configuration][a note]]
for details.
