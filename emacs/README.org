* Emacs Configuration
This is an Emacs configuration that uses [[https://github.com/akirak/emacs-twist][emacs-twist]] to manage package version.

** Structure
The following files configure Emacs Lisp packages:

- [[file:emacs-config.org][emacs-config.org]]: The main configuration file.
- [[file:compat.el][compat.el]]: My personal compatibility layer. Its content should be mostly keybindings I grew in [[https://github.com/akirak/emacs.d/][my previous config]].
- [[file:extras.org][extras.org]]: A collection of extra configurations for specific tasks.

The following files should be the contents of =user-emacs-directory=:

- [[file:early-init.el][early-init.el]]
- [[file:init.el][init.el]]

The following files and directories are needed for building the configuration using Twist:

- [[file:lock/][lock/]]: A directory for lock files.
- [[file:recipes/][recipes/]]: Custom recipes for packages that are not available on any package registry.

[[file:.org-config.el][.org-config.el]] contains my Org configuration for maintaining the configuration. See [[file:emacs-config.org::#develop-org-configuration][a note]]
for details.
